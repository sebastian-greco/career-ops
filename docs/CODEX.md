# Codex Setup

Career-Ops supports Codex through the root `AGENTS.md` file.

If your Codex client reads project instructions automatically, `AGENTS.md`
is enough for routing and behavior. Codex should reuse the same checked-in
mode files, templates, tracker flow, and scripts that already power the
Claude workflow.

## Prerequisites

- A Codex client that can work with project `AGENTS.md`
- Node.js 18+
- Playwright Chromium installed for PDF generation and reliable job verification
- Go 1.21+ if you want the TUI dashboard

## Install

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Recommended Starting Prompts

- `Evaluate this job URL with Career-Ops and run the full pipeline.`
- `Scan my configured portals for new roles that match my profile.`
- `Generate the tailored ATS PDF for this role using Career-Ops.`

## Routing Map

| User intent | Files Codex should read |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Raw JD text or job URL | `modes/_shared.md` + `modes/auto-pipeline.md` |
| Single evaluation only | `modes/_shared.md` + `modes/oferta.md` |
| Multiple offers | `modes/_shared.md` + `modes/ofertas.md` |
| Portal scan | `modes/_shared.md` + `modes/scan.md` |
| Jobgether scan | `modes/_shared.md` + `modes/scan-jobgether.md` |
| PDF generation | `modes/_shared.md` + `modes/pdf.md` |
| Live application help | `modes/_shared.md` + `modes/apply.md` |
| Pipeline inbox processing | `modes/_shared.md` + `modes/pipeline.md` |
| Tracker status | `modes/tracker.md` |
| Deep company research | `modes/deep.md` |
| Training / certification review | `modes/training.md` |
| Project evaluation | `modes/project.md` |

The key point: Codex support is additive. It should route into the existing
Career-Ops modes and scripts rather than introducing a parallel automation
layer.

## Behavioral Rules

- Treat raw JD text or a job URL as the full auto-pipeline path unless the user explicitly asks for evaluation only.
- Keep all personalization in `config/profile.yml`, `modes/_profile.md`, `article-digest.md`, or `portals.yml`.
- Never verify a job’s live status with generic web fetch when Playwright is available.
- Never submit an application for the user.
- In `apply` mode, never fill fields, upload files, solve captchas, or click through the application on the user's behalf. Use the browser only to inspect the live JD and visible form questions.
- Never add new tracker rows directly to `data/applications.md`; use the TSV addition flow and `merge-tracker.mjs`.
- In `apply` mode, treat the live JD as the primary proof source and use reports only as supporting context.
- In `apply` mode, sync only selective reusable application memory to the external tracker app through `APPLICATION_TRACKER_URL` when configured.
- In `apply` mode, also keep salary / compensation answers in the tracker for recordkeeping.
- In `apply` mode, also keep substantive text-entry management / hiring / coaching experience answers when they are reusable narratives rather than simple numeric screening answers.
- In `apply` mode, only store a cover letter in the external tracker if the live form explicitly asks for one.
- Saved tracker Q&A should default to `includeInAiContext: false`.

## Verification

```bash
npm run verify

# optional dashboard build
cd dashboard && go build ./...
